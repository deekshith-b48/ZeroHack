# 🔐 ZeroHack – Decentralized AI-Powered Cyber Threat Defense

**ZeroHack** is a full-stack, next-generation cybersecurity platform that leverages multi-layered AI and blockchain-based forensics to detect, analyze, and autonomously respond to modern cyber threats in real time.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional security systems often:
- Fail to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) such as stealthy or fileless malware.
- Rely on static rules that attackers can easily bypass.
- Store logs in modifiable formats, compromising forensic reliability.
- Respond slowly due to lack of automation.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

ZeroHack addresses today’s cyberattack landscape through:
- **AI-Driven Detection:** Uses natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (CNN/RNN, LSTM, Autoencoders), and transformer models to detect malicious content in traffic, payloads, steganography, and unknown protocols.
- **Advanced Packet Analyzer:** Analyzes payloads, image-based threats, and novel data patterns using deep learning and entropy analysis.
- **Immutable Logging:** Stores verified threat incidents on blockchain (Ethereum/Hyperledger) for tamper-proof audit trails.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate response actions such as IP quarantine and incident logging.

## 🔁 Implementation Flow

1. **Capture Payload or Log File:** Via user upload or live network feed.
2. **Preprocess Input:** Feature extraction, header/payload parsing.
3. **AI-Based Threat Detection:** 
   - **NLP/CodeBERT:** Detects obfuscated command injections and text-based threats.
   - **CNN/RNN:** Identifies steganography, covert channels, and image-based threats.
   - **Autoencoders:** Flags unknown protocols or anomalies.
4. **Threat Scoring & Classification**
5. **Automated Response:** Decide (Allow, Monitor, Quarantine) based on threat score.
6. **Blockchain Logging:** Log incidents using smart contracts for forensic immutability.
7. **Dashboard Visualization:** Real-time threat monitoring and threat history.
